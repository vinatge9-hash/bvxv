- Update menu items in menu.html with your actual dishes, descriptions, and prices.
- Change the brand name in all pages if needed by editing the header section link text.
- If you want to change the color theme, adjust Tailwind utility classes (e.g., bg-yellow-400 to your preferred color) or replace with appropriate color utility classes.

Notes on accessibility and performance
- All images include alt attributes where applicable.
- The layout uses semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, footer).
- The site is responsive and mobile-friendly via Tailwind's responsive utilities.

Deployment
- Open index.html in a modern browser to view the site.
- For production, consider replacing the Tailwind CDN with a built CSS pipeline for optimal performance.
